# Automating-Crypto-Website-API-Pull-Using-Python
In this automating data collection from a cryptocurrency API is the central focus of this project, emphasizing the importance of creating an efficient process for handling data. 

# 🐍 Python API Automation Project (Crypto Data)

The primary goal of this script is to automate the process of pulling cryptocurrency data from a public API, cleaning and transforming the data, and appending it to a dataset (e.g., a CSV file) for analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **API Automation:** Connects to a crypto API and automatically fetches data using Python.
* **Data Cleaning:** Cleans and transforms the raw JSON data received from the API, likely using the `pandas` library.
* **Data Appending:** Automatically appends the new, cleaned data to a persistent file (like a `.csv`).
* **Data Visualization:** (Optional) Includes steps or potential for visualizing the collected data using libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas (for Data Cleaning and Manipulation)
* Requests (for making API calls)
* Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code)
